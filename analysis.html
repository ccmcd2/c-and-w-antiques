                        <ul>
                            <li>On the current website, the hours and contact information are clearly visible on the main page. This is a key piece of information that customers look for on a website, so having it in a noticeable place is beneficial.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To capitalize on this, we should make sure the hours and contact info are easy to find on the redesigned site.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>The content of the navigation makes sense, for the most part (other than the spring tab, nothing seems out of place).</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Changing the Spring tab to a Seasonal tab would help us make good use of the navigation.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Google Maps is integrated into the directions page for ease of use for the customers.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This aspect would be even stronger if we gave an option for Apple maps.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>The owners&#39; experience in the antique industry is described on the about page; this could give the business an edge over its competitors.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To capitalize on this, we should make the descriptions more readable.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>The types of products that the store offers are clearly listed on the website.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>SEO would help us capitalize on this by giving us better organic reach.</li>
                                </ul>
                        </ul>

                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The aesthetics of the site make the business look less credible. The color scheme, layout, font choices, logo, and pictures all make the website look old, out of date, and uncared for.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This can be improved by making the design simpler, more modern, and more functional.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>The page titles for most of the pages are Web Site Name. The page title for the home page is just the URL.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>On the redesigned site, we should make sure to give each page a unique, descriptive title.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>There is a lot of excess scrolling required, especially on the Spring and Products pages because of the layout of the pictures.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Another way of organizing pictures, like a gallery, slideshow, or another component would be best for the redesigned site.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>A lot of the information is a picture of text that does not include any alt text for those using screen readers.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When redesigning the site, we should be sure to include alt text for any images and try not to use images of text.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>On the about page, there are not pictures of the owners, giving the site an impersonal feel.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Adding pictures of the owners to the website will make the customers feel better about the level of care they will receive at the store.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Some content is not visible on the page, at least when viewed on smaller computers.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When redesigning the site, it needs to be responsive and mobile-friendly.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>There are no reviews on the website.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Adding reviews would add a level of trustworthiness to the site that customers are looking for.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>There is a large consumer base for antiques which a well-designed website will draw in to purchase the products from the store.</li>
                            <li>Thanks to the wider availability of the Internet and social media, the number of young people taking interest in antiques is increasing. The website will potentially expand its age demographics to them.</li>
                            <li>During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of people picked up new hobbies such as antique collecting. With a newly designed website backed by SEO, we will be able to reach customers new to the antique industry.</li>
                            <li>With mask mandates ending and many Texans planning to go back to normal, previous customers that have not visited the store for over a year may be looking to return. The new website will give them updates they are looking for, such as changes in hours, reminders of how to get to the store, new products, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Hackers could obtain customer data and financial information. This is low in probability of occurrence but the impact would be detrimental. This can be minimized by utilizing a good security system for the website.</li>
                            <li>Competitors or unhappy customers could leave poor reviews or ratings that could jeopardize the reputation and perception of C&W Antiques. The probability of occurrence is medium and impact is high. We would recommend maintaining control over which reviews appear on the website.</li>
                            <li>The biggest threat to the business is competitors. If our site is more accessible, better designed, more functional, and more informative than those of the competitors, we will win over customers.</li>
                            <li>The hosting site could have network failures and cause this site to be inaccessible.  The probability of occurrence and the impact would be medium level.</li>
