                <h1>CREATIVE BRIEF</h1>
                <h3>1) Background Summary</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The client is C&W Antiques.</li>
                        <li>The products of the client are florals, lighting, lamps, 17-19th century furniture from France & England, oil painting, hall stand, and secretary.</li>
                        <li>SWOT: <a href="analysis.html" target="_blank" title="analysis.html">SWOT Analysis</a></li>
                        <li>We do not have any existing research, reports & documents at the moment.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>2) Overview</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The project is the website redesign for C&W Antiques.</li>
                        <li>The purpose of why we are designing the C&W Antiques website is to improve the appearance, attract more customers, and win over the competitors.</li>
                        <li>Opportunities:
                            <ul>
                                <li>There is a large consumer base for antiques which a well-designed website will draw in to purchase the products from the store.</li>
                                <li>Thanks to the wider availability of the Internet and social media, the number of young people taking interest in antiques is increasing. The website will potentially expand its age demographics to them.</li>
                                <li>During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of people picked up new hobbies such as antique collecting. With a newly designed website backed by SEO, we will be able to reach customers new to the antique industry.</li>
                                <li>With mask mandates ending and many Texans planning to go back to normal, previous customers that have not visited the store for over a year may be looking to return. The new website will give them updates they are looking for, such as changes in hours, reminders of how to get to the store, new products, etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>3) Drivers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The project's goal is to give a better experience for the client's customer through the convenience of a refined website.</li>
                        <li>The top three objectives are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>To increase customers for the client.</li>
                                <li>To give customers easier access and help in the website.</li>
                                <li>To create more business opportunities for the client with an improved website.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The project length will be 14 weeks.</li>
                        <li>The client can expect the result in 14 weeks.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>4) Audience</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our target audience is collectors, historians, and Caucasian women 50 years old and up. Education level is higher education and income of $150,000 and up.</li>
                        <li>They physical experience is pleasant but customers would like options to order online, especially if they live in a different city or state.</li>
                        <li>Customers should care because they want a versatile customer experience and the C&W Antique company is willing to invest in these options to improve overall customer satisfaction.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>5) Competitors</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The competition is local antique stores. Not many of these stores exist and the region has 7 small privately owned antique shops.</li>
                        <li>We should be advertising our options for the full customer experience, such as sales physically in the store, or special online only sales, and alerts when sales start.</li>
                        <li>We are willing to listen to customer feedback and adjust our business model accordingly.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>6) Tone</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Convenience - customers want to be able to find what they are looking for easily and quickly, so the tone should speak convenience and supportive. We need to consider the audience may have limited computer experience, and the easier it is to navigate, the setting and tone of the website should cater to the skill level of the audience.</li>
                        <li>Easy, accessible, accommodating, neighborly, and effortless</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>7) Message</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We are telling people about the store and what it has to offer, about the owners, directions to the store, products we sell, and other miscellaneous information.</li>
                        <li>For the most part, the words are already developed. Some sections may require some minor tweaks in wording.</li>
                        <li>We want our audience to take away our location, hours, and contact information, as well as information about what we sell.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>8) Visuals</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We will be finding new images for this project.</li>
                        <li>We will not be creating the new images ourselves, but we will look for high quality images of antiques that match the design of the new website.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>9) Details</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mandatory information that must be included is basic information about the store (contact information, location, hours, etc.) and information about the available products.</li>
                        <li>Deliverables include: at least 10 webpages, SWOT analysis, and sitemap. The project will be completed by December.</li>
                    </ul>
