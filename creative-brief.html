                    <li><b>Is there existing research, reports and other documents that help you understand the situation?</b><br>We do not have any existing research, reports & documents at the moment.</li>
                </ul>
             <h3>2) Overview</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>What is the project?</b><br>The project is the website redesign for C&W Antiques.</li>
                    <li><b>What are we designing and why?</b><br>We are redesigning the C&W Antiques website to improve the appearance, attract more customers, and win over the competitors.</li>
                    <li><b>What opportunities are we trying to take advantage of?</b><br>We are trying to take advantage of the following opportunities:
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is a large consumer base for antiques which a well-designed website will draw in to purchase the products from the store.</li>
                            <li>Thanks to the wider availability of the Internet and social media, the number of young people taking interest in antiques is increasing. The website will potentially expand its age demographics to them.</li>
                            <li>During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of people picked up new hobbies such as antique collecting. With a newly designed website backed by SEO, we will be able to reach customers new to the antique industry.</li>
                            <li>With mask mandates ending and many Texans planning to go back to normal, previous customers that have not visited the store for over a year may be looking to return. The new website will give them updates they are looking for, such as changes in hours, reminders of how to get to the store, new products, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
